# **App Name**: GTrash: Smart Waste Tracker

## Core Features:

- Live Truck Tracking: Display real-time locations of garbage trucks on a map.
- Smart Proximity Notifications: Send users alerts when the garbage truck is near their location.
- AI Waste Segregation Scanner: Allow users to scan objects and receive AI-powered classification to help them with waste segregation.
- Community Reporting System: Enable users to report illegal dumping with automatic location tagging.
- Gamified Eco-Points: Award eco-points for proper waste disposal, track user's environmental contribution, and encourage engagement using leaderboards.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep green (#006400) to reflect environmental consciousness and sustainability.
- Background color: Dark grey (#222222), nearly black, providing a modern, clean, and contrasting backdrop.
- Accent color: Bright cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, neutral look.
- Use clear, recognizable icons for navigation and actions within the app. Icons should have consistent styling, using green (#006400) when highlighted or selected.
- Implement a grid-based layout for the desktop version, adapting from the mobile design using Tailwind CSS responsive classes. Prioritize proper spacing and alignment to ensure clarity and usability on larger screens. Display the map and the proximity notification panel side by side on larger screens.
- Use subtle animations for UI transitions and interactive elements to improve user experience. This should include smooth map transitions, notification animations, and feedback for user interactions such as reporting or scanning waste.
