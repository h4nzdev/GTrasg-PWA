# GTrash: Smart Waste Tracker

GTrash is a smart-city application designed to improve waste management in Cebu City by connecting residents with garbage collection services through real-time technology and artificial intelligence.

The application solves several major problems:

*   Residents miss garbage trucks because schedules are unpredictable.
*   Trash is often left outside too long, causing environmental hazards.
*   Many households are confused about proper waste segregation.
*   There is no direct way for citizens to report illegal dumping areas.

The system provides these key features:

*   **Live Truck Tracking** — Users can see garbage truck locations and routes in real time on a map.
*   **Smart Proximity Notification** — Users receive alerts when the truck is near their home.
*   **AI Waste Segregation Scanner** — Users can scan an object with their camera and the AI will classify it as biodegradable, recyclable, or residual.
*   **Community Reporting System** — Users can upload photos of illegal dumping or missed pickups with automatic location tagging.
*   **Gamified Eco-Points System** — Users earn points for proper waste disposal and can track their environmental contribution.

The goal of the app is to remove the guesswork in waste disposal and help create a cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable city.
